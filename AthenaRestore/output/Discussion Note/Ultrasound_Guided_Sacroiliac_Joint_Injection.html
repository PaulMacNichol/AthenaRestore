<div><strong>Sacroiliac Joint Injection</strong></div>

<div>
	<p>The patient was positioned prone and the {{left|right}} sacroiliac region was prepped with {{alcohol|chlorhexidine}} in a sterile fashion.</p>
	<p>The ultrasonic anatomy of the hip was examined horizontally using a sterily sheathed {{linear|curved}} Clarius ultrasound probe.</p>
	<p>The reflection of the sacrum was evaluated, and the midline sacral ridge was identified, and lateral to that the first sacral foramen was identified.</p>
	<p>Moving laterally, the ilium was identified, and the interosseous sacral ligament, with the posterior sacral ligament deep to it.</p>
	<p>Intended injection site was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine.</p>
	<p>A 22 gauge {{5|3.5}} inch needle was advanced under live ultrasound guidance, from the medial side with an inferilateral direction to a point deep to the ligament in the space between the ilium and the sacrum to a bony endpoint.</p>L
	<p>idocaine 1% 1-2 ml was injected to confirm easy spread into the joint space.</p>
	<p>Bupivacaine 0.25% 4ml mixed with {{betamethasone 6 mg|triamcinolone 40mg}} was injected, and visualized filling deep to the ligament.</p>
	<p>Needle was removed and a sterile dressing was applied, and the patient was observed to recover from the procedure.</p>
