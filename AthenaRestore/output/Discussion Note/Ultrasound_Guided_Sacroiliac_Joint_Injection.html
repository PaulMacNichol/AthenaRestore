<h4>Sacroiliac Joint Injection</h4>
<p>The patient was positioned prone and the {{left|right}} sacroiliac region was prepped with {{alcohol|chlorhexidine}} in a sterile fashion.  The ultrasonic anatomy of the hip was examined horizontally using a sterily sheathed {{linear|curved}} Clarius ultrasound probe.  The reflection of the sacrum was evaluated, and the midline sacral ridge was identified, and lateral to that the first sacral foramen was identified.  Moving laterally, the ilium was identified, and the interosseous sacral ligament, with the posterior sacral ligament deep to it.  Intended injection site was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine.  A 22 gauge {{5|3.5}} inch needle was advanced under live ultrasound guidance, from the medial side with an inferilateral direction to a point deep to the ligament in the space between the ilium and the sacrum.  to a bony endpoint.  Lidocaine 1% 1-2 ml was injected to confirm easy spread into the joint space.  Bupivacaine 0.25% 4ml mixed with {{betamethasone 6 mg|triamcinolone 40mg}} was injected, and visualized filling deep to the ligament.  Needle was removed and a sterile dressing was applied, and the patient was observed to recover from the procedure.</p>
