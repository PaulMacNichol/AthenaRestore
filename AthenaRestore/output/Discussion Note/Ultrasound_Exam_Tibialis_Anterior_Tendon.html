Using a Clarius ultrasound system using a {{15 MHz linear*|8 MHz curved}} transducer, 2D gray scale B mode, the anatomy of the anterior ankle on the {{left|right}} foot was examined. Examination of the symptomatic leg was done in comparison to the asymptomatic opposite leg. A longitudinal scan of the tibialis anterior tendon on the {{left|right}} leg was performed and recorded, demonstrating {{absence|presence}} of defect, with clear fibrillar pattern of tendon from the patellar insertion to the musculotendinous junction. </strong><br></div><div><strong id="abId0.6647213136282271">Abnormal thickinging {{was not|was}} noted. </strong><br></div><div><strong id="abId0.6947230024007165">Defect {{was not|was}} noted at the site of tenderness. </strong><br></div><div><strong id="abId0.14570557791050764">Defect {{was not|was}} noted at the musculotendinous junction. </strong><br></div><div><strong id="abId0.9371992387241137">The tendon was scanned a second time in the transverse plane, distally from the above the ankle to the midfoot, again identifying the {{absence||presence}} of hypoechoic defect.
