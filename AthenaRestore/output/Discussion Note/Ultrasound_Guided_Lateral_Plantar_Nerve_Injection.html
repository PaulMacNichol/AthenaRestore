<div>
	<p>The patient was positioned supine with the {{left|right}} foot rotated extenally and prepped with {{alcohol|chlorhexidine}} in a sterile fashion.</p>
	<p>The ultrasonic anatomy of the medial posterior foot was examined in an oblique plane using a sterily sheathed {{linear|curved}} Clarius ultrasound probe to visualize the calcananeus, the achilles tendon, and the lateral plantar nerve.</p>
	<p>Images were recorded.  The Intended injection site was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine.</p>
	<p>A 22 gauge {{5|3.5}} inch needle was advanced under live ultrasound guidance, to the vicinity of the lateral plantar nerve.</p>
	<p>Bupivacaine 0.25 % 2 ml mixed with betamethasone 6 mg was injected demonstrating easy spread around the nerve.</p>
	<p>Needle was removed and a sterile dressing was applied, and the patient was observed to recover from the procedure.</p>
