<p>Patient is advised that effective immediately all treatment for pain here at the pain clinic of CRO is terminated. Reasons for termination have been explained to the patient and documented above. I have explained that I would be happy to send medical records on to a new provider pursuant to HIPAA requirements for protection of privacy. A letter to document my statement can be expected in the mail. Since treatment has included high dose opoids, final prescriptions are provided, and he is instructed how to wean off his medication over the coming month.</p>
