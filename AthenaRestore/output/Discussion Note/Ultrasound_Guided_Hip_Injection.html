<h4>Intra-articular hip injection</h4>
<p>The patient was positioned supine and the {{left|right}} hip/groin was prepped with {{alcohol|chlorhexidine}} in a sterile fashion.  The ultrasonic anatomy of the hip was examined longitudinally from the anterior using a sterily sheathed {{linear|curved}} Clarius ultrasound probe.  Femoral head, proximal femur and femoral head/neck junction were all visualized.  Intended injection site was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine.  A 22 gauge {{5|3.5}} inch needle was advanced under live ultrasound guidance, to the point of the junction to a bony endpoint.  Lidocaine 1% 1-2 ml was injected to confirm easy spread into the capsule.  Bupivacaine 0.25% 4ml mixed with {{betamethasone 6 mg|triamcinolone 40mg}} was injected, and visualized filling the joint  capsule.  Needle was removed and a sterile dressing was applied, and the patient was observed to recover from the procedure.</p>
