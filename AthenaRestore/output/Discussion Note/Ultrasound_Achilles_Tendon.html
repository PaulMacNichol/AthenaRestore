<div><strong>Ultrasound Examination of Achilles Tendon</strong></div>

<div>
	<p>The patient was positioned prone and made comfortable. </p> 
	<p>Using a Clarius ultrasound system using a {{15 MHz linear|8 MHz curved}} transducer, the anatomy of the posterior calf was examined.  Examination of the symptomatic leg was done in comparison to the asymptomatic opposite leg.</p>  
	<p>A longitudinal scan of the achilles tendon on the {{left|right}} leg was performed and recorded, demonstrating {{absence|presence}} of defect, with clear fibrillar pattern of tendon from the calcaneal insertion to the musculotendinous junction.</p>  
	<p>Abnormal thickinging {{was not|was}} noted.</p>
	<p>Defect {{was not|was}} noted at the calcaneal insertion.</p> 
	<p>Defect {{was not|was}} noted at the musculotendinous junction.</p>
	<p>The tendon was scanned a second time in the transverse plane, distally from the musculotendionus junction to the calcaneus, again identifying the {{absence||presence}} of hypoechoic defect.</p>
	<p>{{The identified defect (distraction gap) was then measured in flexion and extension and recorded.}}</p>
	<p>The gastrocnemius muscle was subsequently scanned with particular attention to the described area of pain, demonstrating normal muscular fiber pattern.</p>
	<p>Abnormal mass {{was not|was}} visualized.</p>
	<p>There  {{was no|was}} fluid collection superficial to the gastrocnemius muscle.</p>
	<p>There {{was not|was}} evidence of hypoechoic area consistent with intramuscular hematoma.</p>
	<p>There {{was not|was}} evidence of disruption of muscle fibers consistent with muscular trauma.</p>
