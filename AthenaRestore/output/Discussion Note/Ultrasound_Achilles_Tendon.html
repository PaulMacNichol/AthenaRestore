Using a Clarius ultrasound system using a {{15 MHz linear|8 MHz curved}} transducer, the anatomy of the posterior calf was examined.  Examination of the symptomatic leg was done in comparison to the asymptomatic opposite leg.  A longitudinal scan of the achilles tendon on the {{left|right}} leg was performed and recorded, demonstrating {{absence|presence}} of defect, with clear fibrillar pattern of tendon from the calcaneal insertion to the musculotendinous junction.
