</div><div>
</div><div>The patient was positioned  supine and the {{left|right}} shoulder was prepped with {{alcohol|chlorhexidine}} in a sterile fashion.  The anatomy of the AC joint was examined  from the anterior using a sterily sheathed {{linear|curved}} Clarius ultrasound probe.  With the probe superior and parallel to the clavicle, the joint was visualized in a transverse view.  Injection site lateral to the target was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine.  A 22 gauge {{1.5|3.5}} inch needle was advanced under live ultrasound guidance lateral to medial into the joint space.    Lidocaine 1% 1-2 ml was injected to confirm easy spread into the sheath.  Bupivacaine 0.25% 1 ml mixed with {{betamethasone 3 mg|triamcinolone 20mg}} was injected, and visualized filling the joint space.  Needle was removed and a sterile dressing was applied, and the patient was observed to recover from the procedure.</div>
