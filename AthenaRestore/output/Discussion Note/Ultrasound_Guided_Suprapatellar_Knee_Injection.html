<div><strong>Intra-Articular Knee Injection</strong></div>

<div>
	<p>The patient was positioned {{sitting| supine}} and the {{left*|right}} knee was prepped with {{alcohol|chlorhexidine*}} in a sterile fashion.</p>
	<p>The ultrasonic anatomy of the patella was examined longitudinally from the anterior using a sterily sheathed {{linear*|curved}} Clarius ultrasound probe.</p>
	<p>Patella, quadriceps tendon and fat pad were all visualized.</p>
	<p>Intended injection site laterally was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine.</p>
	<p>The transducer was reoriented in a transverse plane, and the same target in the suprapatellar pouch was identified.</p>
	<p>A {{20|22}} gauge {{5|3.5}} inch needle was advanced under live ultrasound guidance, to superior to the midpoint of the patella.</p>
	<p>The needle was aspirated {{but no||and articular fluid}} was returned through the needle.</p>
	<p>Lidocaine 1% 1-2 ml was injected to confirm easy spread into the capsule.</p>
	<p>Bupivacaine 0.25% 2ml mixed with lidocaine 2% 2 ml and {{betamethasone 6 mg|triamcinolone 40mg}} was injected with no palpable resistance.</p>
	<p>Needle was removed and a sterile dressing was applied.</p>
	<p>{{The same techinque was used to examine and inject the opposite knee. }}</p>
	<p>The patient was observed to recover from the procedure.</p>
