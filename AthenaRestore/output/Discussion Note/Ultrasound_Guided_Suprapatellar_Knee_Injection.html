<h3>Intra-articular knee injection </h3><br><br><p>The patient was positioned </p>{{sitting| supine}} and the {{left*|right}} knee was prepped with {{alcohol|chlorhexidine*}} in a sterile fashion. The ultrasonic anatomy of the patella was examined longitudinally from the anterior using a sterily sheathed {{linear*|curved}} Clarius ultrasound probe. Patella, quadriceps tendon and fat pad were all visualized. Intended injection site laterally was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine. The transducer was reoriented in a transverse plane, and the same target in the suprapatellar pouch was identified.  A {{20|22}} gauge {{5|3.5}} inch needle was advanced under live ultrasound guidance, to superior to the midpoint of the patella. The needle was aspirated {{but no||and articular fluid}} was returned through the needle.  Lidocaine 1% 1-2 ml was injected to confirm easy spread into the capsule. Bupivacaine 0.25% 2ml mixed with lidocaine 2% 2 ml and {{betamethasone 6 mg|triamcinolone 40mg}} was injected with no palpable resistance. Needle was removed and a sterile dressing was applied.  {{The same techinque was used to examine and inject the opposite knee. }}, The patient was observed to recover from the procedure.<p></p>
