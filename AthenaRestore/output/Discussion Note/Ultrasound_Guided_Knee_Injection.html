<h4>Intra-articular knee injection </h4>
<p>The patient was positioned {{sitting| supine}} and the {{left|right}} knee was prepped with {{alcohol|chlorhexidine}} in a sterile fashion. The ultrasonic anatomy of the patella was examined longitudinally from the anterior using a sterily sheathed {{linear|curved}} Clarius ultrasound probe. Patella, intrapatellar tendon and fat pad were all visualized. Intended injection site was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine. A 22 gauge {{5|3.5}} inch needle was advanced under live ultrasound guidance, to the point just deep to the patella. Lidocaine 1% 1-2 ml was injected to confirm easy spread into the capsule. Bupivacaine 0.25% 2ml mixed with lidocaine 2% 2 ml and {{betamethasone 6 mg|triamcinolone 40mg}} was injected with no palpable resistance. Needle was removed and a sterile dressing was applied, and the patient was observed to recover from the procedure.</p>
