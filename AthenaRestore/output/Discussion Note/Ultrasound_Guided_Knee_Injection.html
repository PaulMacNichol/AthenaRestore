	<p>The patient was positioned {{sitting| supine}} and the {{left|right}} knee was prepped with {{alcohol|chlorhexidine}} in a sterile fashion.</p>
	<p>The ultrasonic anatomy of the patella was examined longitudinally from the anterior using a sterily sheathed {{linear|curved}} Clarius ultrasound probe.</p>

	<p>Intended injection site was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine.</p>
	<p>A 22 gauge {{5|3.5}} inch needle was advanced under live ultrasound guidance, to the point just deep to the patella.</p>
	<p>Lidocaine 1% 1-2 ml was injected to confirm easy spread into the capsule.</p>
