Intra-articular shoulder injection 
<div>
</div><div>The patient was positioned lateral decubitus and the {{left|right}} shoulder was prepped with {{alcohol|chlorhexidine}} in a sterile fashion.  The anatomy of the shoulder was examined  from the posterior using a sterily sheathed {{linear|curved}} Clarius ultrasound probe.  Humeral head, glenoid articular cartilage and infraspinatus tendon and muscle were all visualized.  Intended injection site was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine.  A 22 gauge {{1.5|3.5}} inch needle was advanced under live ultrasound guideance, deep to the level of the articular cartilage.  Lidocaine 1% 1-2 ml was injected to confirm easy spread into the capsule.  Bupivacaine 0.25% 4ml mixed with {{betamethasone 6 mg|triamcinolone 40mg}} was injected, and visualized filling the posterior joint recess space.  Needle was removed and a sterile dressing was applied, and the patient was observed to recover from the procedure.
