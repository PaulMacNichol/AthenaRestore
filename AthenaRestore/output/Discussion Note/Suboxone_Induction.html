<p>Suboxone treatment initiated under my supervision today, medication administered by me. Patient was observed intermittently over 3.5 hours, confirming effect of incremental doses of suboxone 2/ 0.5 SL, and improvement of patient comfort, and of COWS score by time of discharge. Total dose of suboxone administered is 6 mg. Patient is instructed to continue that dose q 8 h until follow-up visit.</p>
