{{Mr.|Mrs.}} {{____   }} presents today for evaluation for consideration of a radiofrequency ablation of the {{lumbar medial branch|thoracic medial branch|cervical medial branch|genicular|hip articular|lateral sacral branch}} nerves on the {{left|right}} side.

{{He|She}} has previously been evaluated and determined to be a possible candidate for ablation with a working diagnosis of {{spondylosis|osteoarthritis|post-TKA chronic neuropathic knee pain|sacroiliitis}}.

{{He|She}} has undergone successful diagnostic sensory block of the same {{lumbar medial branch|thoracic medial branch|cervical medial branch|genicular|hip articular|lateral sacral branch}} nerves on the {{left|right}} side.  

Based on favorable diagnostic blocks, radiofrequency ablation is expected to provide more durable pain relief and is recommended.

Since most recent evaluation there have been no new medical problems or symptoms that have developed.
