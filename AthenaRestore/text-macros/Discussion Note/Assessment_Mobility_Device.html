<p>Patient has requested a power mobility device for the home. In addition to the examination above, face to face mobility exam reveals the following pertinent issues:</p>
 <p>He has had frequent falls in and around the house, despite use of a cane or walker. Falls appear to be secondary to chronic lumbar radiculopathy, loss of strength and proprioception.</p>
 <p>Patient's upper body strength (past cervical fusion for cervical spinal stenosis) is not adequate to function in a manual wheelchair.</p>
 <p>Patient has the mental capacity to drive a car, and therefore should be able to safely operate a power mobility device in the home, including the tiller steering system. If he had one, he could demonstrate this.</p>
 <p>Patient is safely able to transfer to and from a chair, and therefore able to transfer to and from a mobility device. If he had one, he could demonstrate this.</p>
 <p>Patient can stand and sit upright, and should be able to maintain postural stability and position while operating the device in the home. If he had one, he could demonstrate this.</p>
 <p>I concur with the assessment of {{    }}, PT dated 1{{  }}, and patient has made efforts to declutter the home.</p>
