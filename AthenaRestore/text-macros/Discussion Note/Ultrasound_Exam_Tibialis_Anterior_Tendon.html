<div><strong>Ultrasound Examination of Tibialis Anterior Tendon, {{Right|Left}} Leg</strong></div>

<div>
	<p>The patient was positioned supine and made comfortable.</p>
	<p>Using a Clarius ultrasound system using a {{15 MHz linear*|8 MHz curved}} transducer, 2D gray scale B mode, the anatomy of the anterior ankle on the {{left|right}} foot was examined.</p>
	<p>Examination of the symptomatic leg was done in comparison to the asymptomatic opposite leg.</p>
	<p>A longitudinal scan of the tibialis anterior tendon on the {{left|right}} leg was performed and recorded, demonstrating {{absence|presence}} of defect, with clear fibrillar pattern of tendon from the patellar insertion to the musculotendinous junction.</p>
	<p>Abnormal thickinging {{was not|was}} noted.</p>
	<p>Defect {{was not|was}} noted at the site of tenderness.</p>
	<p>Defect {{was not|was}} noted at the musculotendinous junction.</p>
	<p>The tendon was scanned a second time in the transverse plane, distally from the above the ankle to the midfoot, again identifying the {{absence||presence}} of hypoechoic defect.</p> 
	<p>Peritendinous edema {{was|was not}} noted.</p>
	<p>{{The identified defect (distraction gap) was then measured in flexion and extension and recorded.}}</p>
	<p>The tibialis anterior was subsequently scanned using color flow doppler to identify the dorsalis pedis artery and to identify intra-tendinous patterns of abnormal blood flow with particular attention to the described area of pain, demonstrating absence of abnormal blood flow.</p> 
	<p>Abnormal mass {{was not|was}} visualized.</p>
	<p>There {{was no|was}} fluid collection superficial to the tendon.</p>
	<p>There {{was not|was}} evidence of hypoechoic area consistent with intramuscular hematoma.</p>
	<p>There {{was not|was}} evidence of disruption of muscle fibers consistent with muscular trauma.</p>
