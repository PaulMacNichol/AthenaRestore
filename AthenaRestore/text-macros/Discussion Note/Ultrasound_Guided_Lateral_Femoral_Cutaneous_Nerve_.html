<div><strong>Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block injection</strong></div>

<div>
	<p>The patient was positioned supine with the {{left|right}} leg rotated extenally and prepped with {{alcohol|chlorhexidine}} in a sterile fashion.</p>
	<p>The ultrasonic anatomy of the upper thigh was examined in a transverse plane using a sterily sheathed {{linear|curved}} Clarius ultrasound probe to visualize the sartorius muscle medially and the tensor fascia lata laterally, at a level just distal to the ASIS.</p>
	<p>Images were recorded. The Intended injection site was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine.</p>
	<p>A 22 gauge {{5|3.5}} inch needle was advanced under live ultrasound guidance from the lateral, until the tip was just superolateral to the sartorius muscle, the interval containing the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.</p>
	<p>Bupivacaine 0.25 % 2 ml mixed lidocaine 2% with betamethasone 6 mg was injected demonstrating easy spread around the nerve.</p>
	<p>Needle was removed and a sterile dressing was applied, and the patient was observed to recover from the procedure.</p>
	<p>{{He|SHe}} noted  immediate {{partial|complete}} resolution of the presenting pain complaint.</p>
