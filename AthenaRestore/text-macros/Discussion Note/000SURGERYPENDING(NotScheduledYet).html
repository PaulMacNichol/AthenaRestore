THIS PATIENT AND I INVESTED GREATER THAN 15 ADDITIONAL MINUTES TODAY REVIEWING ALL RELEVENT TREATMENT OPTIONS TYPICALLY EFFECTIVE IN MANAGING THEIR SYMPTOMS. THIS INCLUDED THE POTENTIAL ADVANTAGES AND COMPLICATIONS OF PROGRESSING WITH NO TREATMENT, MULTIPLE CONSERVATIVE MEASURES, OR SURGERY.  

SPECIFIC EDUCATIONAL POINTS WERE IDENTIFIED AND RESOURCES GIVEN FOR THEM TO REVIEW WITH THEIR FAMILY, TRUSTED PERSONAL ADVISORS, AND OTHER MEDICAL PROVIDERS INVOLVED WITH THEIR CARE. THEY WILL BE GIVEN A FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENT TO FURTHER REVIEW THESE TREATMENT OPTIONS AND MY CELL PHONE NUMBER WAS GIVEN TO THEM SHOULD THEY WISH TO CONTACT ME EARLIER.
