<div><strong>Ultrasound Examination of Quadriceps Tendon, {{Right|Left}} Leg</strong></div>

<div>
	<p>The patient was positioned prone and made comfortable.  Using a Clarius ultrasound system using a {{15 MHz linear*|8 MHz curved}} transducer, 2D gray scale B mode, the anatomy of the anterior thigh on the right leg was examined.</p>
	<p>Examination of the symptomatic leg was done in comparison to the asymptomatic opposite leg.</p>  
	<p>A longitudinal scan of the quadriceps tendon on the {{left|right}} leg was performed and recorded, demonstrating {{absence|presence}} of defect, with clear fibrillar pattern of tendon from the patellar insertion to the musculotendinous junction.</p>
	<p>Abnormal thickinging {{was not|was}} noted.  Defect {{was not|was}} noted at the patellar insertion.</p>
	<p>Defect {{was not|was}} noted at the musculotendinous junction.</p>
	<p>The tendon was scanned a second time in the transverse plane, distally from the patellar insertion to the musculotendionus junction, again identifying the {{absence||presence}} of hypoechoic defect. {{The identified defect (distraction gap) was then measured in flexion and extension and recorded.}}</p>
	<p>The quadriceps muscle was subsequently scanned with particular attention to the described area of pain, demonstrating normal muscular fiber pattern.</p>  
	<p>Abnormal mass {{was not|was}} visualized. There  {{was no|was}} fluid collection superficial to the quadriceps tendon.  There {{was not|was}} evidence of hypoechoic area consistent with intramuscular hematoma.  There {{was not|was}} evidence of disruption of muscle fibers consistent with muscular trauma.</p>
