<p>Patient informed that current behavior is suggestive of an opioid addiction problem.  Such problems are best treated with detoxification, abstinence and possibly suboxone.  I advise she seek such a course of treatment.  However, until she is prepared to do so, I will continue to prescribe long acting opioid only, provided she can comply with the treatment plan.  If she is unable to comply with the opioid treatment plan, then opioid treatment will be discontinued entirely.</p>
