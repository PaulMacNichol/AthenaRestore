<p>The patient has responded to diagnostic nerve block of the {{left|right|bilateral}} SI joint under fluoroscopic guidanc on {{ }} and wishes to proceed with radiofrequency neurotomy of the same joint. Diagnostic blocks were performed on {{ }} with patient reported more than 50% pain relief {{ }}%  on each occasion.</p>
<p>The patient has physical examination consistent with SI joint as pain generator, and radiographic evidence of deterioration of the SI joints.</p>
<p>The patient has implemented conservative treatment measures that include  home exercise for more than 3 months, oral opioids and oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents without relief of pain.</p>  
<p>The patient  completed a course of physical therapy without improvement of pain, {{concurrently#|prior to my evaluation|on dates_________}}.  The patient has not had fusion surgery at the level to be treated. The patient does not have evidence of radicular pain.  Plan, range of possible outcomes, anticipated benefits as well as potential complications of RF ablation procedure has been discussed with the patient.  Risks of nerve injury, neuritis, increased pain, infection, injury to the blood vessel, and lack of benefit have been discussed.  {{He|She}} accepts plan and associated risks and wishes to proceed.  Also, I have discussed the planned use of anesthesia in order to improve comfort during the planned procedure.  Patient understands that all anesthesia involves risks that cannot be eliminated.  More common problems are minor, such as nausea, headache, post-procedure pain, and can be treated.  More serious problems including heart problems, breathing problems, nerve injury, stroke or death are all very, very rare.  All questions have been answered.</p>
