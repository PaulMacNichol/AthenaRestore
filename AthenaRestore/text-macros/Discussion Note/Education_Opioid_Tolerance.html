<p>Fifteen minutes spent discussing why use of opioids for chronic pain has only limited benefit.  I have explained, once again, that progressive escalation of opioid dosing to achieve some sort of stable high-quality pain relief is not possible in the long term.  I have explained that as chronic opioid dose escalates, the hazards come to exceed the benefits.  For this reason. opioid dose will not be escalated at this time.</p>
